      <p><strong>Biography</strong></p>
      <p>James McNeill Whistler, in full James Abbott McNeill Whistler, (born July 11, 1834, Lowell, Massachusetts, U.S.â€”died July 17, 1903, London, England), American-born artist noted for his paintings of nocturnal London, for his striking and stylistically advanced full-length portraits, and for his brilliant etchings and lithographs.</p>
      <p>Whistler was born of Scottish-Irish ancestry. As a boy, he spent some time in Russia at St. Petersburg, where his father was a civil engineer; after a short stay in England en route, he was back in the United States by 1849. He attended the United States Military Academy at West Point, but he soon abandoned the army for art.</p>
      <p>During the 1860s Whistler moved between England and Paris. He also visited Brittany (1861) and the coast near Biarritz (1862), where he painted with Courbet and evinced that love of the sea that was to mark a number of his later small oil studies and watercolours. In 1863 Whistler settled in London, where he found congenial themes on the River Thames, and the etchings that he did of such subjects garnered praise from the poet and critic Charles Baudelaire when they were exhibited in Paris.</p>
